### Breakout Variation Ideas

### Interesting Existing Game Variations

 * Devilish is definitely an interesting variation because rather than clearing the screen after a level and then resetting it for the next level,
 the game flows smoothly into the next level with a passage. This continuity seems like it requires a different type of code structure, but it adds
 to the gameplay. 

 * Super breakout is another variant we think is interesting becasue of the different types of power-ups that can be implemented. By adding power-ups, the game becomes a lot more fun and adds another level of depth.
