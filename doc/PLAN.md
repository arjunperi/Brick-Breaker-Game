### Breakout Variation Ideas

### Interesting Existing Game Variations

 * Devilish is definitely an interesting variation because rather than clearing the screen after a level and then resetting it for the next level,
 the game flows smoothly into the next level with a passage. This continuity seems like it requires a different type of code structure, but it adds
 to the gameplay. 

 * Super breakout is another variant we think is interesting becasue of the different types of power-ups that can be implemented. By adding power-ups, the game becomes a lot more fun and adds another level of depth. We think that this variant allows for a lot of creativity in the power-ups we might want to implement. 


#### Block Ideas

 * Crumbly block - when the ball hits this block the block is removed but the ball maintains the same direction.

 * Strong block - this block has multiple lives and thus must be hit by the ball multiple times before it is removed. 

 * Power up block - when this block is hit by the ball, the block is removed and a power-up is rewarded. 


#### Power Up Ideas

 * Extra life power up

 * Ball speed reduction power up

 * Max size power-up (the paddle grows to the size of the bottom of the screen, so there is no way the ball can hit the bottom and the game essentially autoplays for a period of time)
